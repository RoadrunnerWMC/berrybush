Blender addon for BRRES models, particularly with New Super Mario Bros. Wii modding in mind.

Main features include:
- BRRES importer & exporter with support for most features of the format
- Render engine and new material editing interface
- Verifier to catch possible mistakes in model data

BerryBush is targeted at Blender 3.3 LTS, but works with Blender 3.4 as well. Wider support is planned in the future. A more detailed summary of BerryBush's current scope and limitations can be found [here](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/wiki/Scope-and-Limitations).

# Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/releases/latest). In Blender, open **Edit > Preferences... > Add-ons > Install...**, and then choose the ZIP file you downloaded. A more detailed step-by-step guide can be found [here](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/wiki/Installation). After installation, check out the rest of [the wiki](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/wiki) to get started.

The same process can be used to update BerryBush to a new version. You can also [uninstall the addon](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/wiki/Installation#Uninstalling-BerryBush) from the same menu.

# Support

Detailed guides and documentation are available in [the wiki](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/wiki). Additionally, if you're ever unsure what something does within Blender, you can hover over it to view its description.

Feature requests, bug reports, documentation corrections, or other feedback are all welcome on [the issues page](https://github.com/hayden0729/berrybush/issues). Note that this project is mainly intended for New Super Mario Bros. Wii modding, so although it may happen to work for other games, NSMBW-related features are the primary concern.
